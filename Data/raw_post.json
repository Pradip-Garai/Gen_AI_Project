Stammering. Feeling like an outsider.\n\nImposter syndrome even after building something massive.\n\nAnd then we went where most founders never go:\nFiring people.\nHurting people.\nThe ugly side of scale.\nThe stuff leaders pretend doesn’t happen.\n \nHe even talked about delivery partner conditions.\nWhat the protocols are.\nWhat needs to improve.\n \nThe part of the system nobody wants to look at because it ruins the dopamine of ordering.\n\nMost people in his position would just not bother talking. But he opened up about anything we threw at him.",

But that detail says everything about his character.\n\nNothing is too small.\nYou show up prepared. Always. \nBecause that’s showing respect to a stage, an opportunity. \n\nLeft the episode with a lot of respect and had fun watching.\nDid any of you watch yet?",
